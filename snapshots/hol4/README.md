# Snapshot of HOL4 output for Sail CHERI and RISC-V models

These theories are a snapshot of the generated files for the Sail
CHERI and RISC-V models, translated to HOL4 via Lem.  These are all
accepted by the current source repository version of HOL4 (from
roughly 7th May 2018), although we have not done any further testing
of them yet.

They were generated using the `cheri-mono` branch of Sail, and the
`hol-with-extra-types` branch of Lem, which currently contain some
changes that are not yet ready of the main branches of these projects.

11th May 2018.
